<p class="leading-text">I am a UX designer with over eight years experience. Passionate about creating user centric, meaningful, beautiful digital products that solve problems for real people.</p>

  <h2 class="secondary-heading">Senior UX designer, Intellectual Property Office</h2>
  <p class="sub-secondary-heading">April 2015 &mdash; December 2015</p>

  My aim before I joined the IPO was to raise the bar in terms of the quality of design of services being built and to change the focus to deliver good looking, effective and user centred services. In my time at the IPO, I have built a UI library that defines a set of controls to be used across services, utilising common components that we know from the frontend toolkit and elements and further enhancing with bespoke controls, this was the first thing I set out to achieve in order to ensure consistency and quality.

  I have been involved in multiple work streams on different projects and am lead designer on a new internal, staff facing system. I have forged great relationships with business analysts and key users across the business to gather requirements and test hypotheses through UX lead user story mapping and sketched and browser based prototypes; tweaking them along the way, based on user feedback. These prototypes have formed the basis of the Alpha prototype, developed within a strict timescale, for GDS assessment in September 2015.

  <h2 class="secondary-heading">UX/Web designer, Companies House</h2>
  <p class="sub-secondary-heading">October 2007 &mdash; April 2015</p>

  Companies House is highly regarded as a forerunner of digital transformation in Government and is highly respected in and around government for pioneering great ideas and products for their customers.

  At Companies House, I was responsible for creating and ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience for our online services. More recently, I focussed on designing a new service that rationalised three existing online services into one “experience” where users can search the registry for any of the 3.4 million registered companies in the UK, and can file for that company once authenticated.

  From the project's inception, I worked in an agile, multidisciplinary team, as the sole designer, building the frontend framework from the ground up. Through analysing user feedback through questionnaires and observational usability studies, I designed and built a “mobile first”, cross-browser,, responsive service with a user experience that allows users to achieve exactly what they came to the site to do within minutes, with minimal ‘clicks’. For a government service, and in comparison to legacy services (which are still live), this is a breath of fresh air for users and is a significant improvement on what they have been forced to use over the years.

  I have a detailed knowledge of the GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit. I have been involved in its iterative improvement from the early stages of its development and have an in depth knowledge of the GOV.UK elements used to define numerous design patterns for services across government and they help design services that meet the governments service standard.


  <h2 class="secondary-heading">Website project coordinator, New Horizons</h2>
  <p class="sub-secondary-heading">January 2007 &mdash; October 2007, Part-time alongside 3rd year of University</p>

  Whilst at my third year in university, I was approached to lead the web team at a local mental health charity as they had seen my work for their patron, Boyd Clack. Collaborating with him, I designed a website for his TV show Satellite City. My duty was to liaise with local authority councillors, mental health workers and clients to maintain and improve the New Horizons website and the larger, further reaching, regional Rhondda Cynon Taff mentalhealthsupport.co.uk website.
