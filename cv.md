  As UX designer at IPO, I was involved in multiple work streams on different projects and was lead designer on a new internal, staff facing system. I forged great relationships with business analysts, product owners and key users across the business to gather requirements and test hypotheses through UX lead user story mapping and sketched and browser based prototypes; tweaking them along the way, based on user feedback. The prototypes formed the basis of the final Alpha deliverable, developed within a strict timescale, for GDS assessment in September 2015 and was successful.

  My aim before I joining the IPO was to help raise the bar in terms of the quality of design of services being built and to change the focus to deliver good looking, effective and user centred services. In a small, new and evolving UX team, I helped establish the core principles on which we delivered quality services.

  I built a UI library that defined a set of controls to be used across services, utilising common components from the frontend toolkit and elements and was further enhanced with bespoke controls, this was the first thing I set out to achieve in order to ensure consistency and quality.

  At Companies House, I was responsible for creating and ensuring a seamless, efficient and accessible user experience for online services.

  As lead UX designer I designed a new service that rationalised three existing online services into one “experience” where users can search the registry for any of the 3.4 million registered companies in the UK, and can file for that company once authenticated. This is now in Beta and is being used by thousands with great feedback.

  In 2011 I lead design on customer experience improvement project which sought to drastically improve the user interface for the online filing service.

  Designed and built a new intranet using Drupal in 2010.

  Lead design and HTML/CSS coding of the filing service to fall in line with web standards, accessibility guidelines and delivered a service that conformed to the Companies Act with a definitive legislative deadline in 2009.

  Whilst at my third year in university, I was approached to lead the web team at a local mental health charity as they had seen my work for their patron, Boyd Clack. Collaborating with him, I designed a website for his TV show Satellite City. My duty was to liaise with local authority councillors, mental health workers and clients to maintain and improve the New Horizons website and the larger, further reaching, regional Rhondda Cynon Taff mentalhealthsupport.co.uk website.
