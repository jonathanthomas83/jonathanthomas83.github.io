<h2 clas="heading-medium">/Me</h2>
<p>I've worked in agile, multidisciplinary teams for my entire career. Following the design principles, I work an iteration or two ahead of development. I lead user story mapping workshops to learn about user needs and behaviours and produce quick, hand drawn wireframes that tackle user requirements and add value.</p>

<p>Through user feedback, I iterate wireframes and develop quick, high fidelity HTML mockups that are then developed into live services. I support developers and lead and facilitate sprint planning with a UX slant.</p>

<p>I am passionate about inclusive design, keep a keen eye on code quality and like to maintain reusable libraries of HTML, styles and scripts. I have a wealth of experience designing government services and have a detailed knowledge of GDS design patterns.</p>
