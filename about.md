<h2 class="heading-large">my job</h2>
<p>I work in an agile, multidisciplinary team and have done for my entire career. Following the design principles, I work an iteration or two ahead of development. I lead user story mapping workshops to learn about user needs and behaviours and produce quick, hand drawn wireframes that tackle user requirements and add value.</p>

<p>Through user feedback, I iterate wireframes and develop quick, high fidelity HTML mockups that are then developed into live services. I support developers and lead and facilitate sprint planning with a UX slant.</p>

<p>I collaborate daily with testers and developers. I have lead storyboarding workshops with users, as well as UX lead sprint planning workshops with the team I'm in and am comfortable with presenting ideas. I love solving problems and find a great satisfaction through seeing a user successfully reach their goal when using a service I've designed.</p>

<p>I am passionate about inclusive design, keep a keen eye on code quality and like to maintain reusable libraries of HTML, styles and scripts. I have a wealth of experience designing government services and have a detailed knowledge of GDS design patterns.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large">me</h2>
<p>I love the outdoors, enjoy seeing amazing sights and I like mountains. I'm partial to the odd Chinese meal and would probably describe my weekends as chilled and mainly constructed around food.</p>

<p>My main thing in life is music and playing guitar. I have a 1957 reissue Fender Stratocaster which is my pride and joy and learning to get a sound out of my instrument that is anywhere near as beautiful as the sound David Gilmour (<em>Pink Floyd</em>) gets out of his is my life's ambition!</p>

<p>Also have a fondness for football, both playing (badly) and watching (loudly).</p>
