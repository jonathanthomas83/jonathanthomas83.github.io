The **[govuk_prototype_kit]** is a quick and easy way to develop high fidelity prototypes for projects that need to look like Gov.UK. There is plenty of advice on using the kit on the GitHub pages, but here is a quick tutorial for setting up Node.js and NPM on Windows in order to make things just work. It's simple and quick!

Setting up Node.js and NPM
--------------------------
* Download and install **[node.js]** ensuring you using the correct installer for your system (32 bit or 64 bit)
* Run the .msi executable file that is likely now waiting for you in your "Downloads" folder
* Follow the simple step by step installation wizard - there shouldn't be anything to catch you out at this point, just keep all the defaults
* Restart your computer

Test to see if it works
-----------------------
* In your windows search box, type "cmd"
* Right click (or "shift" + "F10") "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator" from the context menu
* When prompted "Do you want to allow this application to make changes to your PC?" choose "Yes"
*
