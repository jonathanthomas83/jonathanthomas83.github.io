As a government organisation, Companies House is the registry of limited companies within the United Kingdom. Companies House is highly regarded as a forerunner of digital transformation in Government and is highly respected in and around government for pioneering great ideas and products for their customers. So creating a new service that would replace three separate existing services that have served customers well for years was a big task, but it also meant that there was a huge user base to draw feedback from.

Requirements
------------
*

Challenges
---------------------------
* Mandate from leadership was that the new service strictly had to follow new GDS guidelines
* The GDS style guide was not mature enough at the beginning of the project, there were no guidelines and GOV.UK had not yet gone into Beta in order to get a clear steer on which direction the general style was going.
* There was little guidance on how to incorporate the GOV.UK Frontend toolkit into your project or how it was to be used or the idea behind how it worked
* The GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit was not mature
* Initial communication with other government designers, including those involved with creating the new style guide, was little and scarce - there was no design group to pose questions to and there was no GOV.UK elements guide to refer to, like there is now

A true litmus test of the test of a design is if users can successfully reach their goal with ease, it is truly satisfying to see this in action. However, another proud moment in a designers career is recognition from peers and leaders in the field. In 2014 I did a show and tell in London with lead designers from GDS, the journey through the service earned significant praise - “This is a perfect example of how to design a service the right way”. When the service went to live beta in December, Mike Brachen (Executive Director, GDS) visited Companies House and had this to say in his blog, “What it gives you is a beautifully designed summary of public information about that company”. Stephen McCarthy, a lead designer at GDS, took the time to compliment my work on twitter when he saw the beta service. It’s a team effort of course, but UX design can sometimes be a thankless task and the subjective and opinionated nature of the design process can be grinding at times, so having positive words from individuals I look up to is rewarding.

From the projects inception, I worked in a large development team as the sole designer, building the front-end framework from the ground up. Through working in an agile environment, analysing user feedback through questionnaires and observational studies, I built a user experience that allows users to achieve exactly what they came to the site to do within minutes, with minimal ‘clicks’. For a government service, and in comparison to legacy services (which are still live), this is a breath of fresh air for users and is a significant improvement on what they have been forced to use over the years.
