My search for the ultimate digital home jukebox, an introduction

<p style="background-color: #EFEFEF; padding: 10px;"><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: For those here for tech info, please feel free to skip over this page, it's a pre-amble back story explaining how I got to the stage of needing and wanting to set up my own music server, the right way.</em></p>

<p><strong>For years, I've been in search of the ultimate music library, the best jukebox-ey [<em>sic</em>] way of playing that library and the best Hi-Fi audio that I could afford. These three pieces are essential to solving the  music enthusiast or audiophile's conundrum. In the following series, I will discuss some of the fantastic hardware, software and opportunities that us enthusiasts have at our fingertips to create the set-up we've always wanted, without the constraints that many consumers become accustomed to. I'll go into detail on how I built my dream audio setup to last.</strong></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>My first real memory of falling in love with music as I was growing up was the road trips. My father would take me for a drive and we'd listen to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra_(band)" title="Petra (band)" target="_blank">Petra</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stryper" title="Stryper" target="_blank">Stryper</a> and other gospel music, even rap. Then with my mothers side of the family, I'd often be listening to Michael Jackson, ABBA and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.L.O." title="Electric Light Orchestra" target="_blank">E.L.O.</a>. The broad range of styles and sheer diversity was the key to creating a real passion for music at a young age. That engagement grew into a craving to find and discover new music.</p>

<blockquote>If I don't have a new album to listen to I'm not happy</blockquote>

<p>I became fascinated with the artists and followed them religiously, from a young age it was Michael Jackson, making mix tapes from old 7-inch 45rpm records I found in my uncle's bedroom, from Thriller to Billie Jean, I thought I was the best DJ in the world!</p> 

<p>20 years on and I've acquired over 1,500 CDs and my digital collection comes to over 2.0 terabytes of pure, unadulterated lossless audio - for the old school among us, that's 2,048 gigabytes or 2,097,152 megabytes.</p>

<h3>The collection</h3>

<p>For years I craved a "<em>complete collection</em>", in terms of artist back catalogues, I'm a self confessed "<em>completist</em>". But more recently, after nearly 20 years of collecting physical media, I've grown to realise that it just isn't a sustainable plan - the cost of living is far too much these days and savings need to be made. The fact is, digital media is a lot cheaper than physical media.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I still have all my physical media, but a thought I had earlier this year was "<em>what if one day, all these CDs amount to nothing, what am I left with?</em>" It's a scary thought after spending ludicrous amounts of money on things I cherished so much. It dawned on me that I was literally ripping these CDs to <em>iTunes</em> and watching them sit on a shelf, afraid to touch them or get oily fingerprints on the cover art. Not to mention the sheer amount of living space that the collection was taking up and the costs of storage and display. My mindset needed to change and my approach to collecting needed to shift.</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>Back in 2002, I fell in love with <em>MusicMatch Jukebox</em>. I reveled in the fact that I could pick a genre/mood and it would play a bunch of songs mimicking how I felt that day. MusicMatch died a death when it was bought by <em>Yahoo!</em> in 00's, and I was forced to consider other (substandard, in my opinion) audio players like <em>WinAmp</em>, <em>Windows Media Player</em> (yeah, that didn't last long) and eventually settled with <em>iTunes</em>, mainly because of the <em>iPod</em> interface which was infinitely easier than any other program which was able to transfer to <em>iPod</em>. I ripped my collection a few times before getting it right both in terms of bitrate and file conventions etc, this was my fault but it was a learning experience. But <em>iTunes</em> wasn't ideal when it came to moving the collection around either - it wasn't built for moving your library or cleaning it and keeping it tidy, except for tagging maybe. But my main bugbear was that I was choosing a GUI mainly because I was locked in to the Apple eco-system because I wanted to use an <em>iPod</em>; <em>this overbearing approach has always bothered me, it takes the control away from the user and forces something upon them because the company wants to maintain control over their product and how it's used</em>.</p>

<p>As well as using substandard media players and user interfaces for my music, another bugbear of mine was that I had to settle for sub-par standards in quality with MP3 when I had the CD sitting on my shelf - I'm not entering in to any arguments about sound quality differences between MP3 and CD, but needless to say, I wanted lossless music and I wanted it easier to access. In 2011 I decided that I had enough hard disk memory to rip all of my CDs without any loss in quality using <em><a href="https://xiph.org/flac/">FLAC</a></em>, so I decided that it was time to let go of my CD collection and start digitising it all.</p>

<p>The convenience and efficiency savings I'd make in the long term would far outweigh the pro's of owning so many CDs to essentially "look at". Realistically, I'd have the opportunity to get better audio (through 24bit audio upgrades of my collection, where available digitally) and quite honestly, how often would I take the time to admire the artwork on a CD cover? Not an awful lot. Decision made!</p>

<h3>The solution</h3>

<p>For a long time I managed my audio and newly ripped CDs in <em>MediaMonkey</em> in <em>Windows</em>. The shift to FLAC was a good choice, as I'll explain in a later post, it gave me much more trust in the audio I was listening to, from a pure audiophile's perspective. I was no longer losing quality for the sake of my choice of medium, ie. I wasn't losing quality because I wanted to use <em>iTunes</em >or an <em>iPod</em> for example.</p>

<p><em>MediaMonkey</em>, for those with a <em>Windows</em> setup, is a fantastic music organiser/player, and highly recommended. It's ability to organise every little detail was just what I needed and the multitude of plugins really helped keep everything in check. I found a priceless plugin that would allow me to replace albums with better versions of the same album, which is something that happens a lot during the ripping stage...due to mistakes in the rip etc. However, I found the <em>Windows</em> interface too limiting and <em>MediaMonkey</em> wasn't without it's minor issues, I needed something more robust and also wanted to share my music on a home network and setup protection for my valuable data using a RAID of some sort. The use of <em>MediaMonkey</em>, perhaps more accurately, <em>Windows</em>, was scuppering my experience.</p>

<p>In summer of 2013, <em>Windows</em> crashed for the last time and no longer would I let it cause me issues with my music listening experience. I opted to set up my music server.

<p>I've spent hundreds of hours of research and building the perfect system for my needs and in the coming months, I'll attempt to guide you through my set up, and will try to explain my hardware and software choices to enable you to make informed and personal decisions with your own set up. The following series will be presented as mini-snippets (a lot shorter than this mammoth intro) and tutorials on how to go about creating the best music server/jukebox for your needs. I'm hoping it will translate easily for other media servers, such as video and possibly games etc, which I'll write about later as I tackle those ideas. Finally this guide will be a good reminder for myself and valuable diary of how I can reproduce the work I've done and can enable me to achieve it all again if ever I need to!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and enjoy!</p>
