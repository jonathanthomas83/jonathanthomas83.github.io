Before development could begin, I transformed the initial business analysis from spreadsheets into visual stories that users and the team could understand and align with.

## Requirements and challenges

- Users were stuck using a DOS-style system with black background and green text  
- Tasks were repetitive and time-consuming due to the lack of intuitive UI  
- 30 years of backlogged requirements made it hard to prioritise  
- Users were hesitant to adopt a new interface  
- Sitting with users helped me understand their pain points

## Reviewing the current process

I observed teams across the business to understand their workflows. Tasks that should take 5 minutes took far longer due to the convoluted, keyboard-driven interface.

## The task

- Enable quick and easy data input from customer paper forms via a browser  
- Support seamless updates and creation of patents

## The UX problem

Users had to repeatedly enter the patent number for every action. This redundant process was inefficient and error-prone.

## The solution

- A search-driven app where users select a patent once and perform multiple actions from a unified view

## Actions

- Conducted research with staff across departments  
- Led requirement-gathering workshops and mapped "to be" journeys  
- Built journey maps, low-fidelity sketches, and interactive HTML prototypes  
- Used prototypes to run user testing sessions

## Outcomes

- Rapid sketching and iteration brought user input into the design early  
- Prototypes proved the benefits of change — faster workflows and financial gain  
- Gained trust of stakeholders; praised in internal comms  
- Fully functional HTML prototype used in GDS Alpha Assessment (passed successfully)  
- Prototype guided developer implementation and sprint planning  
- Delivered regular show-and-tell sessions with stakeholders
