<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">DWP Relationships Service</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">In 2020 DWP ambitiously started a journey that would establish common components used across all benefit lines (Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Maternity Allowance etc.). The Service Reference Architecture (SRA) would form the backbone of a major overhaul of how DWP services are build, to better serve its staff and customers.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The Application Reference Architecture (ARA), would form the foundation of the SRA and its applications included payments - servicing customer payment information, residency - surfacing customer address details, security - to ensure secure transactions amongst many others. One of which, was my assignment, DWP Relationships Service.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Relationships is the gatekeeper of customer relationship information in DWP. Ensuring that we capture, store, maintain and serve all types of relationships from parent, child, carer, Power of Attorney, appointees and any other relationship types that DWP benefit lines need to know about. Importantly, we capture this information through any benefit line digital services and we serve the information to all interested parties DWP-wide.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Appointees</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Appointee's are a people associated with a DWP customer via a relationship. An appointee could be a family member, a friend, an organisation, but they are either chosen by the customer to become an appointee or they may nominate themselves to become one in order to take control of the customer's financial affairs if the customer is deemed unable to do so themselves. In DWP's case, to claim the person's benefits for them and to deal with DWP on their behalf.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">In 2021, we decided that we would start to identify important relationships that DWP heavily relies upon for day to day
