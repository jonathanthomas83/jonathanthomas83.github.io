<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">State of play</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">CGI is well known for implementing large scale IT projects and their work has traditionally focussed on infrastructure, backend and database design. Identifying user needs and implementing UCD practices could dramatically improve implementations and establishing a group of practitioners in the field would be wholly beneficial.</p>
<img src="/images/{{ page.image_project }}/{{ page.main_image }}" alt="{{ page.title }}"/>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The task</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I was recruited by CGI to build the capability of the UX practice, to help the business understand the benefits and realise the potential of cultivating a User Centred Design ethos.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Challenges</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>UX and UR roles and techniques were completely new to organisation</li>
  <li>UR was seen as an overhead for time and money</li>
  <li>UR is a specialist function but was considered something anyone could do</li>
  <li>Uniting a group of individuals who enjoyed being the only specialist</li>
  <li>Promoting the benefits of UX</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Actions</h2>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UCD email group</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Taking inspiration from the GOV.UK design email group which has been successful for a number of years, I set up a CGI UCD email group. Bringing together those with a vague interest and seeking out the few individuals who had acted in a UCD related role over the last few years.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">We now have a list of 29 people based around the UK and a number based overseas.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">CGI UK UX Slack group</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I've created a Slack group to enable everyone to ask questions and share ideas, assets and experiences.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Central resource repository</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Established a central storage location for UX resources and assets that can be accessed by anyone internally. The hope is that over time users will populate this with presentations and videos from meetups, shared assets for reuse across projects as well as other useful UCD related content.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Blogging and news articles</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Have written two successful news articles for the weekly newsletter, Pulse, that is distributed to staff. New opportunities with other projects have arisen from these articles.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UCD promotional leaflet</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">With the aim of creating more opportunities for the UCd community. I've created a 2 page leaflet that describes what UCD is and how it can benefit your project.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Meetups</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">As a consultancy, traditionally, people have worked in isolation within CGI. In order to help unite the group, I was determined to start regular meetups where we could socialise, share our ideas and collaborate.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Within 4 months of starting at CGI we had the very first UCD meetup in January 2019. I held another in July and we are due another in December 2019 which may take the form of a group dial-in.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UX Terms of reference</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">One of my first jobs as a UX design lead - one of the first to be recognised in the company, was to put together a "Terms of Reference" document, which outlines the role and its responsibilities. This helps with future recruitment and directs a career path for UC practitioners.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Standards and style guide</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I set a goal to try and unite Front-End development with UX and best practices. On the projects I work on, we now use the GOV.UK Design System. It's my goal to set up a common library of assets for the wider CGI UX community.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility and valid code</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I devised an accessibility audit and checkpoint list that we should go through as developers, to ensure best practices are adhered to. Utilising tools such as the Wave Toolbar and W3C validation tools. The next step is to automate these processes and am currently in talks with Dev Ops about how to do this.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Design reviews</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I created a checkpoint list that needs to be completed after each UI based ticket is worked on by developers. This ensures that the developed version adheres to the design standards set out in the prototypes. This involves developers running mini-show and tells with the UX designer to ensure quality standards are maintained.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">BA presentation</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">In an effort to promote UX services amongst the business. I presented to the Business Analyst community, showing them ways to harness UX and UR techniques in order to improve the quality of their delivery. At the same time as arming them with these techniques, promoted the benefit of having dedicated UX resource on their project.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Mentoring</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I have mentored four front-end developers, apprentices and junior UX'ers in the last year. In an effort to widen capability. I've helped them with UX tasks, talked through their ideas and helped them build a portfolio to showcase their work.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Growing the team</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I have interviewed, recruited and essentially grown UCD capability within the organisation.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Templates</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I have put together helpful templates for helping UCD practitioners create portfolio's and case studies.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UX project lifecycle</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Compiled a document outlining the best practice for how research and design should form part of a successful delivery. Outlining the phases that the project should go through from Discovery to Alpha, Beta and Live and how the process should work in each phase. With the aim of aligning to GDS practices and in order to align with our clients goals</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Slide decks for users</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Each time a UX piece is delivered on a project, a slide deck is created for users, to distribute amongst their community. I use this to promote our services amongst CGI and for our clients.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UX Roadmap</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I want to put together a UX roadmap for how I envisage UX and the UCD practice to operate going forward. Right now. I want to implement UCD as a service that would be available to all projects in all business units across the country. Right now, business units recruit as and when they need resource. But this limits the work that practitioners are able to do. Raising the team above that red tape, allows freedom and flexibility. Creates more work, variation and opportunities and is ultimatelya more attractive proposition for the team.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Summary</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I've achieved a lot in the space of a year but feel that as a company we have so much more to learn, do and to give. I'm confident about the future of the UCD practice within CGI is we can realise its potential and promote the benefits even more.</p>
