<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Discovery</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Knowing nothing about fishing, I was surprised to find out the following:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Currently, the main way of obtaining a fishing licence is at the Post Office</li>
  <li>The licence is for using fishing rods</li>
  <li>Licences last for 12 months maximum and need renewal</li>
  <li>There are different licences for 'coarse fish and trout' only and 'salmon and sea trout'</li>
  <li>For 'salmon and sea trout', you need to report an annual 'catch return'</li>
  <li>Concessions are made for young people, OAPs and Blue Badge holders</li>
  <li>Water bailiff's police the local rivers and lakes</li>
  <li>If caught fishing without a licence, there is a fine of up to &pound;2,500</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Challenges</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>The main demographic is retired males</li>
  <li>Licences are usually bought by women - indicating that the fisher's have asked their wives to fill the forms in and purchase the licences</li>
  <li>Users are not 'computer savvy'</li>
  <li>Users usually leave licencing to the last minute, e.g. grandfather taking grandson out for the day tomorrow and needs a 1 day licence</li>
  <li>Users liked having physical licences and it was a contentious subject to go fully digital for licences</li>
  <li>Should we allow 'multibuy' purchases for groups of fishers?</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Creating a digital service for those who wish to fish would prove difficult and it was discussed that we may have to offer some kind of incentive, for example, a cheaper licence, to those who applied digitally instead of at the Post Office.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">User journey mapping</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">In order for the team to agree on a suitable MVP for the Alpha release, we did a two day workshop for user journey mapping. Gathering requirements about users and chatting to the product owners and stakeholders about who our users were and how they needed the service to work.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Formulating a content and design backlog</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">I proceeded to get a map of content and questions that we needed answers to in order to formulate a usable and effective service that would enable users to get a licence of their choice, quickly. These post it notes formed the backlog of work that was needed for us to complete the alpha prototype. At every stage of this planning session, the development team were heavily involved and as a team, we agreed on next steps.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prototyping</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Using the GOV.UK prototype kit, I created a fully functioning prototype that allowed users to choose their type of licence and all of the different permutations that came along with that, using routing.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Everything was committed to GitHub in order to aid collaboration and version control.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">User research</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">User reasearch took place across the country at various venues. The first one being at a Fishing Exhibition in Manchester where attendees were asked for a few minutes to try out the new alpha service. I personally did some field reasearch and gorilla user testing at a local fishing tackle shop in Bristol, and again users responded positively to the service.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">GDS Alpha assessment</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The service passed the GDS alpha assessmet in April 2016.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Shortly after, the service went in to beta development and is available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences/buy-a-fishing-licence">'Buy a rod fishing licence'</a>.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Summary</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Despite my distinct lack of knowledge about fishing before I started this project, it was one of the most exciting projects I'd had the pleasure of being involved in. It was a fun project and offered up some unique problems along the way.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Our initial hypothesis about the majority of users not being computer savvy were proven correct, but the service we designed was so simple and effective that when we tested with those users, they were happy that it worked for them. Although, some still insisted that they would ask their wives to go to the Post Office for them.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Digital licences were being trialled at the User Research events to mixed reaction, most preferring a physical copy of the licence so they had it at hand when prompted by water bailiffs.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We also found that the bailiff's would need some way of having a digital database of licenced fishers on them whilst on duty. This would need to be up to date as often they'd be in remote areas with no internet access.</p>
