## State of play

CGI is well known for implementing large scale IT projects and their work has traditionally focussed on infrastructure, backend and database design. Identifying user needs and implementing UCD practices could dramatically improve implementations and establishing a group of practitioners in the field would be wholly beneficial.

## The task

I was recruited by CGI to build the capability of the UX practice, to help the business understand the benefits and realise the potential of cultivating a User Centred Design ethos.

## Challenges

- UX and UR roles and techniques were completely new to organisation  
- UR was seen as an overhead for time and money  
- UR is a specialist function but was considered something anyone could do  
- Uniting a group of individuals who enjoyed being the only specialist  
- Promoting the benefits of UX  

## The goal

Build a world class centre of excellence made up of great UCD practitioners.

# Actions

## UCD email group

Taking inspiration from the GOV.UK design email group, I set up a CGI UCD email group. We now have a list of 29 people based around the UK and a number based overseas.

## CGI UK UX Slack group

I've created a Slack group to enable everyone to ask questions and share ideas, assets and experiences.

## Central resource repository

Established a central storage location for UX resources and assets. The hope is that users will populate this with meetups, shared assets, and other useful UCD content.

## Blogging and news articles

I’ve written two successful articles for the internal newsletter *Pulse*, which led to new opportunities on other projects.

## UCD promotional leaflet

Created a 2-page leaflet that describes what UCD is and how it can benefit projects.

## Meetups

To reduce isolation among practitioners, I started regular meetups. Within 4 months of starting, we had the first UCD meetup in January 2019. Another followed in July, and a third is planned for December 2019.

## UX Terms of Reference

As one of the first recognised UX leads, I created a “Terms of Reference” document outlining the role and responsibilities — aiding recruitment and career paths.

## Standards and style guide

I unified Front-End and UX using the GOV.UK Design System and began work on a shared library of assets for the wider CGI UX community.

## Accessibility and valid code

Devised an accessibility audit checklist using tools like Wave Toolbar and W3C validators. Working with DevOps to automate this process.

## Design reviews

Introduced a checkpoint list for UI tickets to ensure developed work adheres to design standards, including mini show-and-tells with UX designers.

## BA presentation

Presented to the Business Analyst community to demonstrate how UX and UR techniques can improve delivery and project outcomes.

## Mentoring

Mentored four front-end developers, apprentices, and junior UX practitioners — helping them with tasks and building portfolios.

## Growing the team

Interviewed, recruited, and helped grow UCD capability across the company.

## Templates

Created helpful templates for UCD practitioners to build portfolios and case studies.

## UX project lifecycle

Compiled a document outlining the UX process from Discovery to Live, aligning to GDS practices and helping CGI align with client goals.

## Slide decks for users

Produced slide decks after each UX delivery — used for sharing internally and promoting services to clients.

## UX Roadmap

Envisioned UCD as a service available to all projects across CGI. A centralised approach would create more work, variety, and opportunities, and ultimately be a more attractive proposition for the team.

# Summary

I've achieved a lot in the space of a year, but there is still much to learn and do. I’m confident about the future of the UCD practice at CGI if we can continue to realise its potential and promote its benefits.
