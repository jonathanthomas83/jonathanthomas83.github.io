<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reviewing the current process</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">During a site visit to Southampton Magistrates Court, I identified an issue where administrators had to confirm a number of sittings each day. If they do not complete this task regularly, it becomes more cumbersome and takes longer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">To prove that work was needed, I devised a short questionnaire, to which a large percentage of users responded that confirming sittings takes them over an hour a day.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The UX problem</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Confirming sittings is done by entering the calendar view of the session rota, they call this the "mantain rota" screen. They must click each day individually, and subsequently click "confirm" next to the relevant sittings.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Challenges</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Currently, Rota administrators manually confirm attendance of judiciary after court sessions have taken place</li>
  <li>Administrators manage multiple court venues, each with many sessions per day</li>
  <li>Sessions are confirmed by clicking the day and manually clicking "confirm" next to each session individually
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>No short cuts</li>
      <li>Time consuming</li>
      <li>Resource intensive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Design requirements</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Design a journey that would allow users to confirm multiple sittings at the same time</li>
  <li>Negate the need to enter the calendar view to confirm sittings</li>
  <li>Have a user friendly list of unconfirmed sittings</li>
  <li>Confirm all unconfirmed sittings with minimal "clicks"</li>
  <li>Have the ability to filter by court venue</li>
  <li>Ability to edit a court session before confirming</li>
  <li>Design needs to align with GDS standards</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Actions</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Reviewed the current process</li>
  <li>Gathered requirements with staff interviews and surveys</li>
  <li>Created sketch prototype for new workflow</li>
  <li>Presented ideas back to client and users</li>
  <li>Revised and refined the designs through 5 iterations of design work, UR and show &amp; tells</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The solution</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The first thing an administrator sees when they sign in is a menu. A full list of unconfirmed sittings is now only one click away from this menu.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">They can filter by relevant criteria such as court venue and can sort in order of latest to oldest sitting, so they can prioritise which needs confirming first.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">A requested feature was the ability to edit a session before confirming it, something that they are currently unable to do.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Most importantly, they can use a "select all" function to neatly select all the unconfirmed sittings in one go.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Outcomes</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Through demonstrating the failings of the current system and the quick completion rates of the new prototypes, I was able to convince the client that this change would bring instant benefits to staff workflow and ultimately would bring financial gain through quicker processing.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Users were shown these screens throughout the design process and they have been thoroughly user tested and proven to work much more efficiently than the current "confirm sittings" process.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The client gained trust in me as a designer through my efforts to prove that we could dramatically improve this mundane process for users and cut down hundreds of man hours spend on confirming sittings by the hundreds of rota administrators across the country, every single day Thus meeting business objectives for them.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Ultimately, the large percentage of users who spent over an hour a day on this task, now only need to spend less than a few minutes to carefully chack an accurate and curated list. So the vast majority of work is automated for them. As well as saving money, it will vastly improve the daily workflow for many users.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Further work identified</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Users have highlighted that they need to be able to perform swaps of judiciary between court sessions from the confirm screen</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Screens</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">This is an early prototype showing what it would be like to be able to "select all" from the current screen. It was visualised only to show how much better the new journey could be. But was also used as an option for the client to choose if they wanted a "quick and easy" solution.</p>
