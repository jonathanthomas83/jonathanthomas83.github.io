<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Requirements and challenges</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Through interviews and on site visits with rota administrators, I identified the need to simplify the look and feel of the calendar screens. These screens are used daily to carry out most admin tasks. They are overly complex and show a lot of information. The screens serve many functions, so I had to maintain the functionality whilst removing the complexity.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">A redesign also needed to align with GDS standards.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Things that needed to be fixed:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>The need to scroll horizontally to see Friday, Saturday and Sunday</li>
  <li>What is clickable an what's not?</li>
  <li>Misaligned columns as users scroll down screen to different venues</li>
  <li>Reliance on a key to describe what the multicoloured badges mean</li>
  <li>Key is repeated multiple times as you scroll down screen</li>
  <li>Lots of confusing icons/&ldquo;badges&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<img src="/images/{{ page.image_project }}/{{ page.main_image }}" alt="{{ page.title }}"/>

<p class="govuk-body">The key thing was that rota administrators had to scroll horizontally to see the entire week of session information. But realistically, administrators had learned to deal with the quirks of this design, and put up with it out of necessity. Those new to the role would have to be taught how to use this screen. More work was needed than to simply "make it all fit on one screen".</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Constraints</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Tasked to complete development and release the redesign before the new rota period in March.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The UX problem &ndash; &ldquo;What is clickable?&rdquo;</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">When I first saw this screen, I was overwhelmed, but also didn't realise that everything is &ldquo;clickable&rdquo;. Everything on the screen has a function. For example, the days of the week at the top are links to allow the users to confirm sittings that magistrates have attended. The days of the week are bold and black and don't look like links.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">As a new user joins the organisation, they would be tasked to &ldquo;confirm yesterdays sittings&rdquo;. For existing users, this is a learned behaviour. But when new users aren't familiar with the quirks of the design, evidence shows that it leads to frustration.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Actions and achievements</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Discovery User research</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Devised a questionnaire asking for feedback on the current rota application for administrators.</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>101 users responded</li>
  <li>Over 90% of users struggle with horizontal scrolling</li>
  <li>Users like the current design as they are accustomed to it</li>
  <li>However, would like it to be easier to understand for new users</li>
  <li>Spend too much time training new users</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Prototyping</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Functional Sketch prototype:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Redesigned the calendar view
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>No more scrolling</li>
      <li>All columns aligned as you scroll</li>
      <li>Accessible "badges" using the 'acronym' tag</li>
      <li>No more keys</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Redesigned magistrate "swaps"</li>
  <li>Judiciary search engine</li>
  <li>Validation</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">The redesign was well received by users, despite their lack of appetite for change. They said that they will miss the colour coding, but understand it's not accesible.</p>

<img src="/images/{{ page.image_project }}/sketch.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}"/>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Swaps</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Administrators regularly 'swap' magistrates in and out of court sessions, using a UI tool which currently has problems in that it allows swpas that shouldn't happen.</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Completely overhauled a dated and broken 'swap' system</li>
  <li>Compiled an extensive list of rules:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Errors that prevent swaps</li>
      <li>Warnings that advise admins to confirm before permitting a swap</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A more intuitive UI</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Praised by users and thought to be a big improvement on the current functionality.</p>

<img src="/images/{{ page.image_project }}/list.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}"/>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Front-end design as part of a team</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Worked closely with the lead developer, tester and Business Analyst to ensure quality.</p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Show and Tell</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">I lead three show and tell sessions with a forum of users representing Local Justice Authorities (LJA's) across the country. This allowed me to get early feedback and to make quick changes to the prototype before it went to development.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">User research</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">User testing</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The design has been tested with users and has been iterated upon numerous times, which is a big achievement given constraints of project timescales.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Initial frustrations of the new design were that it lacked the colour coding of the original system. However, this has been designed to be easy to use for people of all abilities, including those with colour-blindness. Overloading the screen with colour to indicate importance would make it hard to use for those users and would undermine and detract from the deliberate use of colour upon validation.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Another point made by users was that there were more screens. However, there are less screens as currently there are modal windows that open and obscure the view of the main screen.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Despite early reservations, the majority of tested users liked the changes and said that it would be easy to get used to. Furthermore, even those who disliked it upon first impression, they managed to get through tasks set them within just a few seconds. Proving that it works and is intuitive.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Post-testing iteration</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The following were some of the issues identified at user testing and needed to be improved upon:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: The lack of colour made counting "vacancies" harder<br />
    <strong>Fix</strong>: Use a link/button to toggle "Show vacancies only"
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: "Swap" button disappears off screen as users scroll<br />
    <strong>Fix</strong>: Have a static bar at the top of the screen which scrolls with the user
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: Swap box was too bix for users screens and they missed the validation above the box, when scrolled down screen<br />
    <strong>Fix</strong>: Put swaps in the static bar at the top of the screen which scrolls with the user
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: After editing a session, users get taken back to a closed calendar<br />
    <strong>Fix</strong>: Maintain an open calendar and navigate users back to the correct, court venue and week they were on before editing
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">a) Original design - the "Swap" button dissappears as users scroll down.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Lessons learned</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Users</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">It's been a challenge to get to interact with users enough.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Limited User Research</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Usually large scale changes like this would go through multiple revisions before settling on the final developed version. I've done three "Show and tell" feedback sessions with users and two rounds of user testing. I'd have liked to have done more iteration on the design and more user testing.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Development before User Testing</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">A common issue for UX designers to have to deal with is the urgency to press on with development before sufficient user testing and design has happened. We ended up testing a developed version with users. Any changes that result from that testing would need to be charged back to development, not UX, therefore adding costs to the project.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Design constraints</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The design challenge imposed was to get this as "right" as possible and as close to what users are used to without causing too much disruption to their work. This left little room for maneouvre in terms of having the ability to make wholesale changes.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s subheading govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">"Like for like"</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The new design couldn't be seen to remove functionality for users. Many users expected functions on the calendar view that I originally designed to sit elsewhere because it would be "better" or more user friendly for them. However, after further user research, I ended up moving that functionality back to its original place, in order to meet needs of users who were attached to the original way of doing things.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Summary and outcomes</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">This has been a successful redesign and has delivered a truly efficient and well received enhancement. It's made users lives easier and has allowed the UI to be more intuitive for new users.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">I've gained client and more importantly, users' trust by involving them as much as possible in the design process. Ensuring that I've taken into consideration their needs, despite my initial inclination to design things differently - which has proven challenging.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">I've proven to the client that UX prototyping (using Sketch) is a viable solution to getting ideas out to users rapidly, and it has been a great tool to help aid the design process. It's allowed users to pinpoint what will and won't work and it has allowed me to correct issues quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">This redesign will save many time and money in the long term, for the client. It negates the need for complex onboarding and learning to use the old system and all it's intricacies as it removes the complexity from such an overwhelming string of screens.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Users like it, although they are still used to the old design and it's quirks, they think it's an improvement and will help quicken to onboarding process as the new design is more intuitive.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Screens, design decisions and design patterns</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">This shows the "judiciary menu" that administrators needed access to. This is current functionality, and the idea was to remove it from the screen to remove complexity. It got reinstated after user feedback.</p>
<img src="/images/{{ page.image_project }}/main-switch.png" alt="{{ page.title }}"/>

<p class="govuk-body">The session edit now exists on a separate screen, simplifying things for users and makes things more usable and accessible. From a development perspective, it opens up opportunities to share this functionality with other parts of the system that was simply impossibe with the old view. E.g. with the <a href="/case-studies/rota-confirm-sittings/">new confirm sittings functionality</a>.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">This deviates from the traditional "one thing per screen" approach prescribed by GDS as it's not as granular as they advise. However, it suits this use case for quick input and tested well with users.</p>
<img src="/images/{{ page.image_project }}/edit-session.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}"/>

<p class="govuk-body">Trying to stay within GDS guidelines for a calendar presentation was challenging and required thinking outside of the box. Standardisation and consistency was key. Links were kept to a minimum in order to focus the user on tasks.</p>
<img src="/images/{{ page.image_project }}/main-switch-calendar.png" alt="{{ page.title }}"/>

<p class="govuk-body">Also given it's own screen rather than an inaccessible overlay, is the judiciary search functionality. Allowing for better accessibility and usability.</p>
