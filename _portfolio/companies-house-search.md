As a government organisation, Companies House is the registry of limited companies within the United Kingdom. Companies House is highly regarded as a forerunner of digital transformation in Government and is highly respected in and around government for pioneering great ideas and products for their customers.

At Companies House, I was responsible for creating and ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience for our online services, using a front-end design stack. More recently, I focussed on designing a new service that rationalised three existing online services into one “experience” where users can search the registry for any of the 3.4 million registered companies in the UK, and can file for that company once authenticated.

From the projects inception, I worked in a large development team as the sole designer, building the front-end framework from the ground up. Through working in an agile environment, analysing user feedback through questionnaires and observational studies, I built a user experience that allows users to achieve exactly what they came to the site to do within minutes, with minimal ‘clicks’. For a government service, and in comparison to legacy services (which are still live), this is a breath of fresh air for users and is a significant improvement on what they have been forced to use over the years.
