Getting users to try a different UI to the one they’re used to has been a challenge. By sitting with users and learning how they work, I got a feel for how they struggled with the current system. I’ve been able to justify reasons for changing current processes, through demonstrating how to improve them. In doing this, I’ve been able to gain the trust of key stakeholders and they have been impressed with the simplicity of the service I’ve designed for them; it has a great user experience and it meets business objectives and is valuable to everyone invested in it. Recently, a senior manager of a section I have been working with took the time to praise my efforts and thank me for the work I’d done for them by way of writing an article in a staff newsletter.
