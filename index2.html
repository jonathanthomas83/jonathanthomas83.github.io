      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>I work in agile, multidisciplinary teams; following the design principles, I work an iteration or two ahead of development. I lead user story mapping workshops to learn about user needs and behaviours and produce quick, hand drawn wireframes that tackle user requirements and add value.</p>

      <p>I am passionate about inclusive design, keep a keen eye on code quality and like to maintain reusable libraries of HTML, styles and scripts. I have a wealth of experience designing government services and have a detailed knowledge of GDS design patterns.</p>
